# The Story Behind Animation and VFX

![Intro photo of talk where we can see Benjamín Haverla in sketch style.](Photos/Storytelling_still.png)

Often when I'm trying introduce myself, it's quite interesting because I'm only able to give you the cover of my personality. Let me give you an example. One guy will tell me like, Hi, Benjamin! Nice to meet you. By the way, what are you studying? And I will tell him animation and visual effects. And this guy will react like, wow, that’s really cool. Because sometimes I have these types of reactions. But when I have short time to talk about my animation and visual effects field, I'm not able to give this person the story behind the animation and visual effects and well, this is going to be our topic. So my secret is that as an animator, I can't draw. You can see it also in this slide. And this were my drawing skills when I was younger. So it's funny and, Well, now I'm going to be honest with you. I mean, that you will know about my personality more because I have time here to discuss it. My dream is to become a film director. And I know, and I'm realizing that it's a difficult journey, and it can be also painful. But inside me, you know, I feel that this is something what I want to do. But of course, I like also other things. For example, I like to work with video sometimes animation. And also I like to think about, camera movements or, for the right composition. So basically, almost everything around, about filmmaking. Also, you know, I was a background actor in some bigger productions, and I enjoyed to be in front of camera a little bit. And also I enjoyed to watch all film crew how they are trying to solve problems, how they are shooting, different scenes. So it was amazing experience and the point is... That after my high school, I tried to apply, to film directing university in our capital city in Bratislava, but they didn't accept me, which was hurting but I was expecting, that this is going to happen because, it's really hard to apply there, honestly. And we have only in Slovakia just one university about filmmaking. I know also about the second university, but, this university has a lot of bad reviews. So then, you know, I tried at least to apply somewhere where I can study anything about filmmaking. And, this is the reason why I'm here. I mean, I'm a student at University of Creative Communication, which is specialized also in animation, visual effects, and, first class was also really difficult because we had, professional, some lessons, and he was also Slovak teacher and he worked for Disney as a storyboarder and also 2D animator. I don't remember
exactly what he was doing, but, if I remember well, he was working with the storyboards and 2D animation and, you know, when he saw my drawing skills, my drawing skills, where, like,
you can see in this slide, he said, Benjamin, you’re at the university and you don't have the basic skills of the drawing. If you really want to do this, you need to work on yourself very hard, because with these types of drawing skills, you have no chance to apply on some professional studio. And I think he's right.

I mean, he didn't tell these sentences
exactly how I'm telling you but

the meaning was something like this,
because I can't remember

every detail of the sentence,
but that was the meaning.

And he was right. I mean, and

also thanks to this situation,
I was asking myself

if I am on the right place or,

yeah...

is it really true
that with no drawing skills

I won’t be a good filmmaker
or these things..?

or a good director,
because also I met some teachers

and they said to me that if I want to be
a director, I should draw nice that

because if I, won't be able to draw
nice things,

then it will be for me,
really hard to be as a film director.

And these people are right.

And this is the part
where I want to motivate you

that accept the criticism,
but when you feel, this criticism

is hurting your personality like a knife
which is stuck in you and you're bleeding.

You don't want to lose all blood
because then you will die, right?

So try to put this knife away
as soon as it is possible. And

I think this is helpful.

So, we need to find balance between, 
criticism, which can help us

to improve, and also criticism,
which is destroying your personality.

If the criticism is destroying
your personality,

try to put it away
as soon as it is possible.

You know, my grandma,
she gave me perfect lesson

and she has this lesson
also from her father and that's about that

accept information
with one ear inside and second ear

outside. In some,

things it can be really helpful.

Well, so it was, for me, really hard,
the first class.

And why I want to motivate you in this way

because, thanks,
that I survived my university.

I’m, in last class, by the way, and I,

how to tell I was patient,

and I try to still, follow my dream

also, that I was

realizing that I can’t draw
nice as a film director.

Future film director. We will see!

Yeah...

Well...

You know, after some time,
I learned something.

And, when I was in Berlin,
I did internship,

in Berlin,
and I was hanging out with my colleagues,

and we went, to the bookshop,
and there was a filmmaking section.

So, you know, I like filmmaking.

So I went, there and,

you know, I saw in front of me

because everything was
everything was in, German's language.

But, I saw in front of me
one book in English language.

And I felt that this book is calling me.

And when I came closer to this book,

I opened this book
and I felt that I'm totally in different

world.

And my colleagues,

they were checking other books,
but I stuck with this, book, and that's,

as you can see, shot by shot
film directing.

I learned from this book
a lot, and very motivational information,

which I couldn't find in my university,
for example.

And I'm not telling that
that's the mistake of my university.

It's just personal growing, you know,

it's my personal improvement.

So this is also my advice.

You can accept it,
but of course, you don't have to.

It's totally up to you.

I'm just want to share my, 
life story to you and motivate you.

Because, you know, I have a lot of friends
who are disappointed in themselves

because they failed in something or for
some of my friends

is very important what other people think
is which is, I think not

okay If you want to follow your dream.

also search for other sources because, 
thanks to this,

if you are searching for other sources,
not just from your own place,

you can be open minded.

And this book, in Berlin,
helped me to understand some things.

And the motivational part is coming now
because you know how

where my drawing skills and...

this is the easiest storyboard
which you can make.

It's really cool.

You know, guys, it's just you need to use
the right words to explain the story.

See? another example...

It's just, the right words.

And the storyboard
editor will understand this.

I don't know if in Czech Republic
it works like that or in Slovakia,

but I am pretty sure that abroad,
if I will go more abroad,

they have these

positions, and storyboard
editor will understand what I want to tell

Medium Close Up.

00:08:38:03 - 00:08:39:05
C.U.

00:08:39:05 - 00:08:41:26
Yeah...

00:08:41:26 - 00:08:44:26
Well, another example.

00:08:46:11 - 00:08:47:05
As you can see,

00:08:47:05 - 00:08:50:17
you can use, like, two windows
as one shot.

00:08:51:02 - 00:08:54:10
So window, which is up,

00:08:56:01 - 00:08:57:01
it looks like a map.

00:08:57:01 - 00:08:59:18
So I can totally understand
where camera will be,

00:08:59:18 - 00:09:02:22
where the character, will move,
where is the car.

00:09:03:06 - 00:09:06:09
And, the second window,

00:09:07:10 - 00:09:10:10
is just showing the camera angle

00:09:10:24 - 00:09:14:02
and, also the car movement.

00:09:14:14 - 00:09:17:17
So thanks to these two windows,
you can also explain the scene

00:09:17:17 - 00:09:18:20
and people will understand.

00:09:18:20 - 00:09:20:29
So there's a lot of options
and variations.

00:09:20:29 - 00:09:22:25
See also not professional drawing

00:09:22:25 - 00:09:26:15
and some famous directors,
made this type of shots

00:09:27:02 - 00:09:30:14
and we can totally understand what's the

00:09:32:00 - 00:09:35:00
main point, about this shot.

00:09:35:27 - 00:09:37:23
Also with rectangle,

00:09:37:23 - 00:09:40:26
we can explain the perspective
or the camera angle.

00:09:40:26 - 00:09:43:01
Again simple drawings.

00:09:43:01 - 00:09:46:01
There's a rectangle which is helping us
to understand the perspective

00:09:46:15 - 00:09:49:12
and cool we understand.

00:09:49:12 - 00:09:53:06
But of course there's a situation
when, you need nice drawings.

00:09:53:17 - 00:09:54:18
I'm not experienced,

00:09:54:18 - 00:09:58:16
but I think if I want to sell some story
to some producer and I need the money

00:09:59:02 - 00:10:03:10
to make this project, real,
I will need nice drawing.

00:10:03:10 - 00:10:06:10
And I was wondering about myself and

00:10:07:11 - 00:10:09:07
I'm not worried to ask for some help

00:10:09:07 - 00:10:12:10
for some artist who can draw nicer than I.

00:10:12:28 - 00:10:13:22
Thanks for this book.

00:10:13:22 - 00:10:18:29
I learned to tell better the visuals and,
how scene should look

00:10:19:01 - 00:10:22:08
so I can tell the story,
which is in my head,

00:10:22:23 - 00:10:27:13
but I can ask for help,
you know, for some storyboard artist

00:10:27:13 - 00:10:31:21
or some artist who can, realize
and make nicer these drawings,

00:10:31:21 - 00:10:36:22
then probably the producer can like,
the visuals, how they looks so

00:10:38:15 - 00:10:39:18
I learned that

00:10:39:18 - 00:10:42:18
there's a lot of options in our life.

00:10:43:21 - 00:10:47:00
And this storyboard is not from the book,
shot by shot.

00:10:47:00 - 00:10:51:02
But this is how I can draw nowadays,
of course, if you

00:10:51:08 - 00:10:56:13
if you will give me a pencil and paper,
I can draw like you

00:10:56:13 - 00:11:00:02
saw on my, 
second slide of the presentation,

00:11:01:05 - 00:11:04:05
but,

00:11:04:15 - 00:11:06:23
if I have... you know, I found my style.

00:11:06:23 - 00:11:10:27
So if I have, digital pen

00:11:12:04 - 00:11:14:08
and

00:11:14:08 - 00:11:16:09
tablet

00:11:16:09 - 00:11:19:07
I... and some computer, I mean,

00:11:19:07 - 00:11:23:02
thanks to references,
I can, make these nice drawings.

00:11:23:09 - 00:11:25:29
Of course, if I'm going to compare myself
with the other artists.

00:11:25:29 - 00:11:27:28
So they can draw nicer than I.

00:11:27:28 - 00:11:30:12
But I think this is, really enough,

00:11:30:12 - 00:11:33:12
and it's improvement about my personality.

00:11:33:12 - 00:11:36:25
how I want to explain better, to you.

00:11:37:17 - 00:11:41:15
What is my vision and how,
how I would like to tell the story.

00:11:43:06 - 00:11:45:26
And this is, for me, important.

00:11:45:26 - 00:11:49:02
remember, guys,
this is my motivation for you.

00:11:49:21 - 00:11:53:22
So if you feel the system is trying
somehow force you to do just one thing.

00:11:53:22 - 00:11:58:01
always try to be open minded,
and search for the other sources.

00:11:58:26 - 00:12:01:03
we have a lot of cultures here, yeah...

00:12:01:03 - 00:12:04:03
on this earth and,

00:12:04:18 - 00:12:07:04
accept the criticism
because really, criticisms can,

00:12:07:04 - 00:12:09:07
help you to improve in some ways.

00:12:09:07 - 00:12:14:28
But when there is a point when you feel
that this criticism is hurting

00:12:14:28 - 00:12:18:10
you and it's destroying your personality,
try to put it away as soon as possible.

00:12:18:10 - 00:12:21:01
So just trust yourself.

00:12:21:01 - 00:12:24:24
This is just my example
how I improve myself that I was patient.

00:12:24:24 - 00:12:27:22
Yeah, I had to accept that
I'm not good like the others.

00:12:27:22 - 00:12:30:25
And I was searching for some way
and after some time

00:12:30:25 - 00:12:33:25
I found it, somehow.

00:12:33:29 - 00:12:35:19
And I think this is how it works.

00:12:35:19 - 00:12:39:18
If you are not scared
to stand up and walk again

00:12:39:18 - 00:12:43:07
and make a lot of failures
because you want your dream, right?

00:12:43:14 - 00:12:47:06
Life is testing us
if we really want what we want. So,

00:12:48:13 - 00:12:51:16
yeah, search for the other sources,
accept the criticism.

00:12:51:16 - 00:12:54:16
But when you feel the criticism
is destroying your personality,

00:12:54:22 - 00:12:57:22
try to put it away as soon as it is
possible.

00:13:00:02 - 00:13:03:06
Well, and, with this slide.

00:13:03:06 - 00:13:08:19
I would like to tell you that,
what is also important, in our lives,

00:13:09:09 - 00:13:11:29
I mean, this is my point of view,
and you can accept this.

00:13:11:29 - 00:13:15:16
And also, you don't have to,
it's totally up to you.

00:13:15:29 - 00:13:19:21
But what I learned here on the earth
is that,

00:13:19:21 - 00:13:23:16
if you want to be truly happy,
what is good,

00:13:24:21 - 00:13:27:21
I mean, it's good to have,
honest friendships,

00:13:28:09 - 00:13:31:25
good relationships with your family. And,

00:13:33:06 - 00:13:35:17
also when you are helping someone.

00:13:35:17 - 00:13:37:27
This three things can help, to...

00:13:38:28 - 00:13:40:15
in my

00:13:40:15 - 00:13:44:29
opinion, thanks to this,
you can have, energy to always stand up

00:13:44:29 - 00:13:48:09
and try to pass again
the fail your failure.

00:13:48:23 - 00:13:50:23
I mean, follow your journey.

00:13:50:23 - 00:13:54:25
And also you can feel really happy
and it will be for you

00:13:54:25 - 00:13:57:25
easier to pass, bad periods in your life.

00:13:58:25 - 00:14:00:18
Because I have bad periods in my life.

00:14:00:18 - 00:14:02:27
And I hope you don't have...

00:14:02:27 - 00:14:06:06
I think probably that, yes,
you have bad periods in your life too,

00:14:06:06 - 00:14:09:17
and I wish for you that you don't have
so many bad periods in your life.

00:14:10:02 - 00:14:13:23
But I learned that, true friendships,

00:14:14:00 - 00:14:18:08
also honest relationship
with your family, the good relationships.

00:14:18:24 - 00:14:21:27
And when you are helping someone,
this is helping you

00:14:21:27 - 00:14:25:05
to overcome all obstacles, in your life.

00:14:25:23 - 00:14:29:25
And also when you will achieve your goal,
you can, feel truly happy

00:14:29:25 - 00:14:31:07
and not lonely.

00:14:31:07 - 00:14:36:26
So, guys, remember that,
if you feel bad and you feel that, like,

00:14:36:26 - 00:14:39:26
you don't know what to do,
I mean, you still searching

00:14:39:26 - 00:14:41:12
and you try to find out who you are.

00:14:41:12 - 00:14:43:08
I'm just want to motivate
you. Don't scare.

00:14:43:08 - 00:14:45:28
Because I had also these struggles.

00:14:47:29 - 00:14:50:17
just try things and you will see
if you like them or not.

00:14:50:17 - 00:14:53:19
Don't worry to try,
because then you can lose a lot

00:14:53:19 - 00:14:56:19
of nice opportunities
and memories in your life.

00:14:56:24 - 00:15:01:13
Well, also if you know what you want to
do, but you somehow still have obstacles.

00:15:01:13 - 00:15:05:10
I know this feeling
and also I want to motivate you.

00:15:05:10 - 00:15:13:11
Don't give up because you will be
surprised how life can help you to find,

00:15:14:23 - 00:15:17:23
who you really are
and what you really want.

00:15:17:28 - 00:15:21:23
when you are trying to achieve your goal
and you can become someone

00:15:22:10 - 00:15:25:10
somehow or someone totally new.

00:15:25:15 - 00:15:27:16
And you can be wise.

00:15:27:16 - 00:15:31:08
Really, you can be wise from all your life
experience and you can help others.

00:15:32:00 - 00:15:34:19
It's everything,
I think, somehow connected.

00:15:34:19 - 00:15:37:09
And as you can see on this slide,

00:15:37:09 - 00:15:39:28
you know, like
every story has the beginning and the end.

00:15:39:28 - 00:15:43:23
Also,
this talk has the beginning and the end.

00:15:45:27 - 00:15:47:07
And that's the same with our life.

00:15:47:07 - 00:15:49:22
Our life has the beginning and the end.

00:15:49:22 - 00:15:54:21
And the question is what we are going
to do with the time which is given to us.

00:15:55:16 - 00:15:59:26
I think probably that I'm quoting, 
Gandalf, from the Lord of the rings.

00:15:59:26 - 00:16:02:26
but... I like Tolkien, by the way.

00:16:03:02 - 00:16:06:02
But I think this is true,

00:16:06:25 - 00:16:08:22
our life has also the beginning
and the end,

00:16:08:22 - 00:16:12:01
and we have no idea
when our life is going to finish.

00:16:12:24 - 00:16:17:24
And I believe what we can bring with
ourselves is, this experience, memories

00:16:17:24 - 00:16:22:22
and values, like a good relationship
with your family, true friendships.

00:16:22:22 - 00:16:25:25
And, when we are helping someone.

00:16:26:09 - 00:16:28:25
And thanks to this,
probably we are able to achieve goals

00:16:28:25 - 00:16:32:00
or be somewhere
where we always wanted to be.

00:16:32:20 - 00:16:36:13
So that's, from me everything, guys.

00:16:36:13 - 00:16:40:21
And I wish you only good things
in your life and successful journey.

00:16:41:05 - 00:16:45:26
And, 
I wish you also true happiness because,

00:16:46:13 - 00:16:49:27
we people I know, we are often
searching for short term happiness,

00:16:49:27 - 00:16:53:21
and we try to catch this happiness
and we are still feel somehow empty.

00:16:54:06 - 00:16:56:26
I don't want to tell you,
because this will be just totally

00:16:56:26 - 00:16:59:24
my point of view, that,
what is for me real happiness.

00:17:00:24 - 00:17:01:20
I mean, if I will

00:17:01:20 - 00:17:04:20
talk about it, more detail but that’s
another topic

00:17:04:25 - 00:17:08:19
I want that you will find, 
find out this by yourself.

00:17:09:00 - 00:17:12:08
so again, I wish you a lot of good things
in your life.

00:17:12:20 - 00:17:13:16
Stay healthy.

00:17:13:16 - 00:17:16:16
Health is very important... And...

00:17:17:18 - 00:17:18:10
have a nice day!
