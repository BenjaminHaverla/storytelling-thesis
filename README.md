# The Story Behind Animation and VFX

![Intro photo of talk where we can see Benjamín Haverla in sketch style.](Photos/Storytelling_still.png)

Often when I'm trying introduce myself, it's quite interesting because I'm only able to give you the cover of my personality. Let me give you an example. One guy will tell me like, Hi, Benjamin! Nice to meet you. By the way, what are you studying? And I will tell him animation and visual effects. And this guy will react like, wow, that’s really cool. Because sometimes I have these types of reactions. But when I have short time to talk about my animation and visual effects field, I'm not able to give this person the story behind the animation and visual effects and well, this is going to be our topic. 

So my secret is that as an animator, I can't draw. You can see it also in this slide. And this were my drawing skills when I was younger. So it's funny and, Well, now I'm going to be honest with you. I mean, that you will know about my personality more because I have time here to discuss it. My dream is to become a film director. And I know, and I'm realizing that it's a difficult journey, and it can be also painful. But inside me, you know, I feel that this is something what I want to do. But of course, I like also other things. For example, I like to work with video sometimes animation. And also I like to think about, camera movements or, for the right composition. So basically, almost everything around, about filmmaking. Also, you know, I was a background actor in some bigger productions, and I enjoyed to be in front of camera a little bit. And also I enjoyed to watch all film crew how they are trying to solve problems, how they are shooting, different scenes. So it was amazing experience and the point is... That after my high school, I tried to apply, to film directing university in our capital city in Bratislava, but they didn't accept me, which was hurting but I was expecting, that this is going to happen because, it's really hard to apply there, honestly. 

And we have only in Slovakia just one university about filmmaking. I know also about the second university, but, this university has a lot of bad reviews. So then, you know, I tried at least to apply somewhere where I can study anything about filmmaking. And, this is the reason why I'm here. I mean, I'm a student at University of Creative Communication, which is specialized also in animation, visual effects, and, first class was also really difficult because we had, professional, some lessons, and he was also Slovak teacher and he worked for Disney as a storyboarder and also 2D animator. I don't remember exactly what he was doing, but, if I remember well, he was working with the storyboards and 2D animation and, you know, when he saw my drawing skills, my drawing skills, where, like, you can see in this slide, he said, Benjamin, you’re at the university and you don't have the basic skills of the drawing. If you really want to do this, you need to work on yourself very hard, because with these types of drawing skills, you have no chance to apply on some professional studio. And I think he's right. I mean, he didn't tell these sentences exactly how I'm telling you but the meaning was something like this, because I can't remember every detail of the sentence, but that was the meaning. And he was right. I mean, and also thanks to this situation, I was asking myself if I am on the right place or, yeah... is it really true that with no drawing skills I won’t be a good filmmaker or these things..? or a good director, because also I met some teachers and they said to me that if I want to be a director, I should draw nice that because if I, won't be able to draw nice things, then it will be for me, really hard to be as a film director. And these people are right. And this is the part where I want to motivate you that accept the criticism, but when you feel, this criticism is hurting your personality like a knife which is stuck in you and you're bleeding. You don't want to lose all blood because then you will die, right? So try to put this knife away as soon as it is possible. And I think this is helpful.

So, we need to find balance between, criticism, which can help us to improve, and also criticism, which is destroying your personality. If the criticism is destroying your personality, try to put it away as soon as it is possible. You know, my grandma, she gave me perfect lesson and she has this lesson also from her father and that's about that accept information with one ear inside and second ear outside. In some, things it can be really helpful. Well, so it was, for me, really hard, the first class. And why I want to motivate you in this way because, thanks, that I survived my university. I’m, in last class, by the way, and I, how to tell I was patient, and I try to still, follow my dream also, that I was realizing that I can’t draw nice as a film director. Future film director. We will see! Yeah... Well... You know, after some time, I learned something. And, when I was in Berlin, I did internship, in Berlin, and I was hanging out with my colleagues, and we went, to the bookshop, and there was a filmmaking section. So, you know, I like filmmaking. So I went, there and, you know, I saw in front of me because everything was everything was in, German's language. But, I saw in front of me one book in English language. And I felt that this book is calling me. And when I came closer to this book, I opened this book and I felt that I'm totally in different world. And my colleagues, they were checking other books, but I stuck with this, book, and that's, as you can see, shot by shot film directing. I learned from this book a lot, and very motivational information, which I couldn't find in my university, for example. And I'm not telling that that's the mistake of my university. It's just personal growing, you know, it's my personal improvement. So this is also my advice. You can accept it, but of course, you don't have to. It's totally up to you. I'm just want to share my,  life story to you and motivate you. Because, you know, I have a lot of friends who are disappointed in themselves because they failed in something or for some of my friends is very important what other people think is which is, I think not okay If you want to follow your dream. also search for other sources because,  thanks to this, if you are searching for other sources, not just from your own place, you can be open minded. And this book, in Berlin, helped me to understand some things. And the motivational part is coming now because you know how where my drawing skills and... this is the easiest storyboard which you can make. It's really cool. You know, guys, it's just you need to use the right words to explain the story. See? another example... It's just, the right words. And the storyboard editor will understand this. I don't know if in Czech Republic it works like that or in Slovakia, but I am pretty sure that abroad, if I will go more abroad, they have these positions, and storyboard editor will understand what I want to tell Medium Close Up. C.U. Yeah... Well, another example. As you can see, you can use, like, two windows as one shot. So window, which is up, it looks like a map. So I can totally understand where camera will be, where the character, will move, where is the car. And, the second window, is just showing the camera angle and, also the car movement. So thanks to these two windows, you can also explain the scene and people will understand. So there's a lot of options and variations. See also not professional drawing and some famous directors, made this type of shots and we can totally understand what's the main point, about this shot. Also with rectangle, we can explain the perspective or the camera angle. Again simple drawings. There's a rectangle which is helping us to understand the perspective and cool we understand. But of course there's a situation when, you need nice drawings. I'm not experienced, but I think if I want to sell some story to some producer and I need the money to make this project, real, I will need nice drawing.

And I was wondering about myself and I'm not worried to ask for some help for some artist who can draw nicer than I. Thanks to this book... I learned to tell better the visuals and, how scene should look so thanks to this I can tell the story, which is in my head. For example, I can ask for help from some storyboard artist or some artist who can, realize and make nicer drawings, then probably the producer can like, the visuals, how they looks. So I learned that there's a lot of options in our life. 

Next storyboard is not from the book, shot by shot. But this is how I can draw nowadays, of course, if you will give me a pencil and paper, I can draw like you saw on my, second slide of the presentation, but, if I have... you know, I found my style. So if I have, digital pen and tablet I... and some computer, I mean, thanks to references, I can, make these nice drawings. Of course, if I'm going to compare myself with the other artists So they can draw nicer than I. But I think this is, really enough, and it's improvement about my personality. how I want to explain better, to you. What is my vision and how, how I would like to tell the story. And this is, for me, important. remember, guys, this is my motivation for you. So if you feel the system is trying somehow force you to do just one thing. always try to be open minded, and search for the other sources. we have a lot of cultures here, yeah... on this earth and, accept the criticism because really, criticisms can, help you to improve in some ways. But when there is a point when you feel that this criticism is hurting you and it's destroying your personality, try to put it away as soon as possible. So just trust yourself. This is just my example how I improve myself that I was patient. Yeah, I had to accept that I'm not good like the others. And I was searching for some way and after some time I found it, somehow. And I think this is how it works. If you are not scared to stand up and walk again and make a lot of failures because you want your dream, right? Life is testing us if we really want what we want. So, yeah, search for the other sources, accept the criticism. But when you feel the criticism is destroying your personality, try to put it away as soon as it is possible. Well, and, with this slide. I would like to tell you that, what is also important, in our lives, I mean, this is my point of view, and you can accept this. And also, you don't have to, it's totally up to you. But what I learned here on the earth is that, if you want to be truly happy, what is good, I mean, it's good to have, honest friendships, good relationships with your family. And, also when you are helping someone. This three things can help, to... in my opinion, thanks to this, you can have, energy to always stand up and try to pass again the fail your failure. I mean, follow your journey. And also you can feel really happy and it will be for you easier to pass, bad periods in your life. Because I have bad periods in my life. And I hope you don't have... I think probably that, yes, you have bad periods in your life too, and I wish for you that you don't have so many bad periods in your life. But I learned that, true friendships,also honest relationship with your family, the good relationships. And when you are helping someone, this is helping you to overcome all obstacles, in your life. And also when you will achieve your goal, you can, feel truly happy and not lonely. So, guys, remember that, if you feel bad and you feel that, like, you don't know what to do, I mean, you still searching and you try to find out who you are. I'm just want to motivate you. Don't scare. Because I had also these struggles. just try things and you will see if you like them or not. Don't worry to try, because then you can lose a lot of nice opportunities and memories in your life. Well, also if you know what you want to do, but you somehow still have obstacles. I know this feeling and also I want to motivate you. Don't give up because you will be  surprised how life can help you to find, who you really are and what you really want. when you are trying to achieve your goal and you can become someone somehow or someone totally new. And you can be wise. Really, you can be wise from all your life experience and you can help others. It's everything, I think, somehow connected. And as you can see on this slide, you know, like every story has the beginning and the end. Also, this talk has the beginning and the end. And that's the same with our life. Our life has the beginning and the end. And the question is what we are going to do with the time which is given to us. I think probably that I'm quoting,  Gandalf, from the Lord of the rings. but... I like Tolkien, by the way. But I think this is true, our life has also the beginning and the end, and we have no idea when our life is going to finish. And I believe what we can bring with ourselves is, this experience, memories and values, like a good relationship with your family, true friendships. And, when we are helping someone. And thanks to this, probably we are able to achieve goals or be somewhere where we always wanted to be. So that's, from me everything, guys. And I wish you only good things in your life and successful journey. And,  I wish you also true happiness because, we people I know, we are often searching for short term happiness, and we try to catch this happiness and we are still feel somehow empty. I don't want to tell you, because this will be just totally my point of view, that, what is for me real happiness. I mean, if I will talk about it, more detail but that’s another topic I want that you will find,  find out this by yourself. so again, I wish you a lot of good things in your life. Stay healthy. Health is very important... And... have a nice day!

Often when I'm trying to introduce myself, it's quite interesting because I'm only able to show you the cover of my personality. Let me give you an example. One guy will say, "Hi, Benjamin! Nice to meet you. By the way, what are you studying?" And I will tell him animation and visual effects. And this guy will react like, "Wow, that’s really cool." Because sometimes I get these types of reactions. But when I have a short time to talk about my animation and visual effects field, I'm not able to give this person the story behind the animation and visual effects, and well... this is going to be our topic.

So my secret is that as an animator, I can't draw. You can see it also in this photo. These were my drawing skills when I was younger. So it's funny, and, well... now I'm going to be honest with you. I mean, you will know more about my personality because I have time here to discuss it. My dream is to become a film director. And I know, and also realize that it's a difficult journey, and it can also be painful. But inside me, I feel that this is something that I want to do. But of course, I also like other things.

After my high school, I tried to apply to a film directing university in our capital city, Bratislava, but they didn't accept me, which was hurtful, but I was expecting that this is going to happen because it's really hard to apply there, honestly.

And we have only one university in Slovakia dedicated to filmmaking. I also know about a second university, but this university has a lot of bad reviews. So, you know, I tried at least to apply somewhere where I can study anything about filmmaking. And this is the reason why I'm here. I mean, I am a student at the University of Creative Communication, which specializes also in animation, and visual effects. The first class was also really difficult because we had professional lessons, and our teacher was also Slovak. He worked for Disney as a storyboarder and 2D animator. I don't remember exactly what he was doing, but if I remember well, he was working with the storyboards and 2D animation. And, you know, when he saw my drawing skills, my drawing skills were, like, you could see before. The teacher said to me, "Benjamin, you’re at the university and you don't have the basic skills of drawing. If you really want to do this, you need to work on yourself very hard because with these types of drawing skills, you have no chance to apply to a professional studio." And I think he's right. I mean, he didn't tell me these sentences exactly how I'm telling you, but the meaning was something like this because I can't remember every detail of the sentence, but that was the meaning. And he was right. I mean, and also thanks to this situation, I was asking myself if I am in the right place or, is it really true that with no drawing skills I won’t be a good filmmaker or these things..? or a good director? Because I met some teachers and they said to me that if I want to be a director, I should draw nicely because if I won't be able to draw nice things, then it will be really hard for me to be a film director. And these people are right. And this is the part where I want to motivate you to accept criticism, but when you feel this criticism is hurting your personality like a knife which is stuck in you and you're bleeding, you don't want to lose all blood because then you will die, right? So try to put this knife away as soon as possible. And I think this is helpful.

So, we need to find a balance between criticism, which can help us to improve, and criticism that is destroying our personality. If the criticism is destroying your personality, try to put it away as soon as possible. You know, my grandma gave me a perfect lesson, and she learned this lesson from her father as well. It's about accepting information with one ear inside and the other ear outside. In some things, it can be really helpful. Well, so it was really hard for me in the first class. And I want to motivate you in this way because I survived my university. I'm in the last class, by the way, and I can tell you I was patient, and I'm still following my dream, even though I realized that I can’t draw nicely as a future film director. We will see! Well... You know, after some time, I learned something. And when I was in Berlin, I did an internship there, and I was hanging out with my colleagues. We went to the bookshop, and there was a filmmaking section. So, you know, I like filmmaking. I went there, and I saw in front of me one book in English. And I felt that this book was calling me. When I came closer to this book, I opened it, and I felt like I was in a totally different world. My colleagues were checking other books, but I stuck with this book, and that's, as you can see, "Shot by Shot: Film Directing". I learned a lot from this book, very motivational information, which I couldn't find at my university. And I'm not saying that it's a mistake of my university. It's just personal growth, it's my personal improvement. So this is also my advice. You can accept it, but of course, you don't have to. It's totally up to you. I just want to share my life story with you and motivate you. Because, you know, I have a lot of friends who are disappointed in themselves because they failed at something or, for some of my friends, what other people think is very important, which I think is not okay if you want to follow your dream. Also, search for other sources because, thanks to this, if you are searching for other sources, not just from your own place, you can be open-minded. And this book, in Berlin, helped me to understand some things. And the motivational part is coming now because you know my drawing skills.. and... this is the easiest storyboard you can make. It's really cool! You know, guys, it's just that you need to use the right words to explain the story. See? Another example... It's just the right words. And the storyboard editor will understand this. I don't know if in the Czech Republic, it works like that or in Slovakia, but I am pretty sure that abroad... if I go more abroad... they have these positions, and the storyboard editor will understand what I want to tell. Well, another example. As you can see, you can use, like, two windows as one shot. So the window, which is up, looks like a map. So I can totally understand where the camera will be, where the character will move, where the car is. And the second window is just showing the camera angle and also the car movement. So thanks to these two windows, you can also explain the scene and people will understand. So there are a lot of options and variations. See also not professional drawing, and some famous directors made this type of shots, and we can totally understand what's the main point about this shot. Also, with a rectangle, we can explain the perspective or the camera angle. Again, simple drawings. There's a rectangle that is helping us to understand the perspective, and cool, we understand. But of course, there's a situation when you need nice drawings. I'm not experienced, but I think if I want to sell some story to some producer and I need the money to make this project real, I will need nice drawings.

And I was wondering about myself... You know I'm not worried to ask for some help from an artist who can draw nicer than I. Thanks to this book, I learned to depict visuals better and how scenes should look. So, thanks to book, I can convey the story that is in my head. For example, I can ask for help from a storyboard artist or an artist who can realize and make nicer drawings of my concepts. Then probably the producer can like the visuals, how they look. So I learned that there are a lot of options in our life.
